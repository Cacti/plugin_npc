*******************************************************************************/


----[ Purpose

    The purpose of NPC is to be a complete web based UI replacement to Nagios while 
    fully integrating into Cacti using the Cacti Plugin Architecture. This integration 
    will provide a single point of access for trending and alert monitoring. 

----[ Features

    1) A complete Nagios UI replacement integrated into Cacti.
    2) A feature rich user interface developed on Ext 2.0. 
    3) A central location to monitor trending and alerting.
    4) All NPC data is updated asynchronously via JSON (no reloading web pages).
    5) Automated importing/syncing of hosts from Nagios to Cacti (N2C).
    6) The UI can be customized on a per user basis.

----[ Prerequisites

    Before you install NPC, you need to have met the following minimum pre-requisites:

    1) Cacti 0.8.7b
    2) Cacti Plugin Architecture v2.0
    3) NDOUtils 1.4b7
    4) Nagios 3.0
    5) PHP 5.1
       - PDO and JSON support are required

----[ Installation

    - Untar/zip npc into <path_to_cacti>/plugins/
    - login to cacti as an admin.
    - install the plugin in Cacti :
        Go to Console -> Plugin Management -> Uninstalled
        Click "Install" under the npc section
        Click the "Installed" tab
        Click "Enable" link under the npc section
    - You can find the plugin options under the Cacti Settings section

----[ Usage

    With the exception of some installation notes documentation is very slim. Watch the forums 
    and the NPC trac site for additional info. Here are a few tips to get you started: 

    * Most lists including services or hosts can be double clicked to open additional detail screens. 

    * Most lists including services or hosts can be right clicked to popup a context menu used to 
      issue service or host commands. 

    * If a graph is mapped to a service or host, a graph icon will be displayed in the hosts and services screens. 
      A single left click of this icon will popup the graph. 

    * Most green check marks (started/enabled) or most red X (stopped/disabled) can be double clicked 
      to toggle the option (requires that remote commands are enabled.) 

    * Most grid columns can be re-ordered via drag and drop. 

    * Most grid columns can be hidden and currently hidden columns can be viewed by clicking a 
      down arrow to the right of the column heading. 

    * Dashboard portlets can be closed or minimized. Closed portlets can be made visible again by clicking the 
      Portlets button on the far right of the toolbar on the Dashboard tab and then select which portlets you want displayed. 

    * All changes to the interface (portlets, column order, etc.) are saved server side on a per user basis. 
      Customize the UI your way and it is available anywhere you login. 

    * Importing Nagios hosts is done from the N2C link on the left side tree menu. Before starting an import you need to
      click in the template field to the right of the hostgroup you are importing. Doing so will expose a select 
      box for assigning a host template.
